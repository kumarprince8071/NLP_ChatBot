# NLP_ChatBot
People usually face issues related to their order after placing it . They again need to visit the restaurant to cancel the order or payment related issues also if a person wants to checks the menu items they need to visit the restaurant which is time consuming in todayâ€™s busy world. That will affect the restaurant business because it is more likely that most people will not visit the restaurant due to less time.

At first we build  a simple chatbot using Machine Learning but the evaluation metrics like Roc-auc-curve and also the confusion matrix are not up to mark(more misclassified points) .So ,We used Deep Learning Methods and build the Neural Network Layers using the SGD ( Stochastic Gradient Descent) Optimizer  with Nestrov Momentum with some Learning Rate and also used Relu as Activation Function so that we lose minimum information during training , Then we choose Categorical Cross Entropy to calculate Loss Function and for Evaluation Purpose we used Accuracy Metric . Lastly We finalized this model and because it was giving the good outcomes and then Deployed it Using Flask.
